# Portfolio UI

This project implements a UI to exhibit portfolio repositories information provided by [the portfolio API](https://github.com/stroparo/gostack-sample-projects-api).

This also solves the ReactJS challenge in level 1 of the GoStack 12th edition by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), a major software development bootcamp in Brazil.
